<h1 align=center>Configuration</h1>
<p>Building the Berkeley DB java classes, the examples and the native support
library is integrated into the normal build process.  See
<a href="../../ref/build_unix/conf.html#--enable-java">Configuring
Berkeley DB</a> and <a href="../../ref/build_win/intro.html">Building for Windows</a>
for more information.
<p>We expect that you've already installed the Java JDK or equivalent on your
system.  Since you are reading this, you also already have a copy of the
Berkeley DB package.  For the sake of discussion, we'll assume it is in a
directory called db-VERSION, e.g., you extracted Berkeley DB version 2.3.12 and
you did not change the top-level directory name.  The files related to
Java are in two subdirectories of db-VERSION: java, the java source files,
and libdb_java, the C++ files that provide the "glue" between java and
Berkeley DB.  The directory tree looks like this:
<p><blockquote><pre>		db-VERSION
	       /          \
	    java        libdb_java
	     |              |
	    src            ...
	     |
	    com
	     |
	 sleepycat
	/         \
       db       examples
       |           |
      ...         ...
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This naming conforms to the emerging standard for naming java packages.
When the java code is built, it is placed into a <b>classes</b>
subdirectory that is parallel to the <b>src</b> subdirectory.
<p>For your application to use Berkeley DB successfully, you must set your
CLASSPATH environment variable to include db-VERSION/java/classes as well
as the classes in your java distribution.  On UNIX, CLASSPATH is a colon
separated list of directories; on Windows it is separated by semicolons.
<p>On Windows, you will want to set your PATH variable to include:
<p><blockquote><pre>db-VERSION/build_win32/Debug</pre></blockquote>
<p>On UNIX, you will want to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include: 
<p><blockquote><pre>db-VERSION/build_unix/.libs</pre></blockquote>
<p>These is where libraries are found after Berkeley DB has been built, but before
the install step.  If you are using Berkeley DB on UNIX, and Berkeley DB has already
been installed, your shared libraries will be installed into a "libs"
subdirectory under the top-level installation directory.  However, the
standard install directory may have been changed for your site, see your
system administrator for details.  Regardless, if you get a:
<p><blockquote><pre>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError</pre></blockquote>
<p>exception when you run, chances are you do not have the search path
configured correctly.
<p>To ensure that everything is running correctly, you may want to try a
simple test from the example programs in:
<p><blockquote><pre>db-VERSION/java/src/com/sleepycat/examples</pre></blockquote>
<p>For example, the sample program:
<p><blockquote><pre>% java com.sleepycat.examples.AccessExample</pre></blockquote>
<p>will prompt for text input lines which are then stored with their
reversed text in a Btree database named "access.db" in your current
directory.  Try giving it a few lines of input text and then
end-of-file.  Before it exits, you should see the reversed text.  This
is a simple check to make sure the fundamental configuration is working
correctly.
