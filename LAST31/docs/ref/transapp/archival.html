<h1 align=center>Archival procedures</h1>
<p>The third component of the infrastructure, archival procedures, concerns
the recoverability of the database and the disk consumption of the
database log files.  There are two separate aspects to these issues.
First, you may want to periodically create snapshots (i.e., backups) of
your databases to make it possible to recover them from catastrophic
failure.  Second, you will periodically want to remove log files in order
to conserve disk space.  The two procedures are distinct from each other,
and you cannot remove the current log files simply because you have
created a database snapshot.
<p>Log files may be removed at any time, as long as:
<ul type=disc>
<li>the log file is not involved in an active transaction
<li>at least two checkpoints have been written subsequent to the
log file's creation, and
<li>the log file is not the only log file in the environment.
</ul>
<p>If log files are first copied to a backup medium before being removed,
they may also be used during restoration of a snapshot to restore your
databases to a state more recent than that of the snapshot.
<p>The Berkeley DB library supports on-line, or <i>hot</i>, backups.  These
are backups where applications continue to read and write the database
and log files while the snapshot is being taken.  Recovery of a hot backup
will be to an unspecified time between the start of the archival and when
archival is completed.  To create a database snapshot as of a specific
time, you must stop reading and writing your databases for the entire time
of the archival, force a checkpoint (see <a href="../../utility/db_checkpoint.html">db_checkpoint</a>), and then
archive the files listed by the <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> utility's <b>-s</b>
and <b>-l</b> options.
<p>It is often helpful to think of database archival in terms of full and
incremental filesystem backups.  A snapshot is a full backup, while the
copying of the current logs before they are removed is an incremental.
For example, it might be suitable to take a full snapshot of an
installation weekly, but archive and remove log files daily.  Using both
the snapshot and the archived log files, a catastrophic crash at any time
during the week can be recovered to the time of the most recent log
archival, a time later than that of the original snapshot.
<h3>Archival for recovery:</h3>
<p>To create a snapshot of your database that can be used to recover from
catastrophic failure, the following steps should be taken:
<p><ol>
<p><li>Run <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> <b>-s</b> to identify all of the database data
files, and copy them to a backup device, such as tape.  If the database
files are stored in a separate directory from the other Berkeley DB files, it
may be simpler to archive the directory itself instead of the individual
files.  If you are performing a hot backup, the utility you use to copy
the files must read database pages atomically (as described by
<a href="../../ref/transapp/reclimit.html">Berkeley DB recoverability</a>).
<p><b>Note: if any of the database files have not been accessed during the
lifetime of the current log files, <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> will not list them
in its output!</b> For this reason, it may be simpler to use a separate
database file directory, and archive the entire directory instead of only
the files listed by <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a>.
<p><li>If you are performing a hot backup, run <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> <b>-l</b>
to identify all of the database log files, and copy them to a backup
device such as tape.  If the database log files are stored in a separate
directory from the other database files, it may be simpler to archive the
directory itself instead of the individual files.
</ol>
<p>The order of these two operations is required, and the database files
must be archived before the log files.  This means that if the database
files and log files are in the same directory you cannot simply archive
the directory, you must make sure that the correct order of archival is
maintained.
<p>Once these steps are completed, your database can be recovered from
catastrophic failure to its state as of the time the archival was done.
To update your snapshot so that recovery from catastrophic failure is
possible up to a new point in time, repeat step #2, copying all existing
log files to a backup device.
<p>Each time both the database and log files are copied to backup media, you
may discard all previous database snapshots and saved log files.  Saving
a new set of log files does not allow you to discard either previous
database snapshots or saved log files.
<p>The time to restore from catastrophic failure is a function of the number
of log records that have been written since the snapshot was originally
created.  Perhaps more importantly, the more separate pieces of backup
media you use, the more likely that you will have a problem reading from
one of them.  For these reasons, it is often best to make snapshots on a
regular basis.
<p><b>For archival safety, ensure that you have multiple copies of your database
backups, that you verify that your archival media is error-free, and that
copies of your backups are stored off-site!</b>
<p>To restore your database after catastrophic failure, take the
following steps:
<p><ol>
<p><li>Restore the copies of the database files from the backup media.
<p><li>Restore the copies of the log files from the backup media, in the order
in which they were written.  The order is important because it's possible
that the same log file appears on multiple backups and you only want the
most recent version of each log file.
<p><li>Run <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> <b>-c</b> to recover the database.
</ol>
<p>It is possible to recreate the database in a location different than the
original, by specifying appropriate pathnames to the <b>-h</b> option
of the <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility.
<h3>Archival to conserve log file space:</h3>
<p>To remove log files, take the following steps:
<p><ol>
<p><li>If you are concerned with catastrophic failure, first copy the log files
to backup media as described above.  This is because log files are
necessary for recovery from catastrophic failure.
<p><li>Run <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> without options to identify all of the log files
that are no longer in use (e.g., no longer involved in an active
transaction).
<p><li>Remove those log files from the system.
</ol>
