<h1 align=center>Deadlock detection</h1>
<p>The first component of the infrastructure, deadlock detection, is not so
much a requirement specific to transaction protected applications, but
rather is necessary for almost all applications where more than a single
thread of control will be accessing the database at one time.  While Berkeley DB
automatically handles database locking, it is normally possible for
deadlock to occur.  It is not required by all such applications, for
example read-only applications cannot deadlock.
<p>When the deadlock occurs, what happens is that two (or more) threads of
control holding locks request other locks that cannot be granted, and
will never be granted because one of the threads of control waiting holds
the requested resource.
<p>For example, consider two processes A and B.  Let's say that A obtains an
exclusive lock on item X, and B obtains an exclusive lock on item Y.
Then, A requests a lock on Y and B requests a lock on X.  A will wait
until resource Y becomes available and B will wait until resource X
becomes available.  Unfortunately, since both A and B are waiting, neither
will release the locks they hold and neither will ever obtain the resource
on which it is waiting.  In order to detect that deadlock has happened,
a separate process or thread must review the locks currently held in the
database.  If deadlock has occurred, a victim must be selected, and that
victim will then return the error DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK from whatever Berkeley DB
call it was making.
<p>Berkeley DB provides a separate UNIX-style utility which can be used to perform
this deadlock detection, named <a href="../../utility/db_deadlock.html">db_deadlock</a>.  Alternatively,
applications can create their own deadlock utility or thread using the
underlying <a href="../../api_c/lock_detect.html">lock_detect</a> function, or specify that Berkeley DB run the
deadlock detector internally whenever there is a conflict over a lock (see
<a href="../../api_c/env_set_lk_detect.html">DBENV-&gt;set_lk_detect</a> for more information).
<p>Deciding how often to run the deadlock detector and which of the
deadlocked transactions will be forced to abort when the deadlock is
detected is a common tuning parameter for Berkeley DB applications.
