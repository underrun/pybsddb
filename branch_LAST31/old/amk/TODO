Still missing: 
  * Test DB_RECNO support
  * Backward compatibility with bsddbmodule possible?
  * Test cursor type
    * Segfault on deallocating cursor (because DB has been deallocated?)
      I think this segfault is now fixed.
  * Expand the test suite until it's complete
  * Docstrings.  
  * Wrap lock_detect() function
  * Should the module always assume multithreading?  I think so...
  * Finally, general tidying, re-indenting, and a careful
reading to catch any stupid errors that I made.
