<h1 align=center>Building transaction protected applications</h1>
<p>When building transactionally protected applications, there are some
special issues that must to be considered:
<p><ol>
<p><li>The Berkeley DB library cannot determine if recovery needs to be performed
before an application uses a Berkeley DB environment; the application itself
must make that decision.  If any thread of control (whether a process or
true thread) exits holding Berkeley DB library resources, recovery must be
performed to recover the resources.  Further, if any thread of control
exits holding library mutexes, recovery must be performed to avoid
starvation as the remaining threads of control convoy behind the failed
thread's locks.  Complicating this issue is the fact that the Berkeley DB
library cannot determine that any thread of control has died.
<p>The rule to use is that recovery must be performed before using a Berkeley DB
environment any time the threads of control previously using the Berkeley DB
environment did not shut the environment down cleanly before exiting the
environment for any reason (including application or system failure).
<p>Requirements for shutting down the environment cleanly differ depending
on the type of environment created.  If the environment is public and
persistent (i.e., the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_PRIVATE">DB_PRIVATE</a> flag was not specified to the
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a> function), recovery must be performed if any transaction was
not committed or aborted, or <a href="../../api_c/env_close.html">DBENV-&gt;close</a> function was not called for any
open DB_ENV handle.
<p>If the environment is private and temporary (i.e., the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_PRIVATE">DB_PRIVATE</a>
flag was specified to the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a> function), recovery must be performed
if any transaction was not committed or aborted, or <a href="../../api_c/env_close.html">DBENV-&gt;close</a> function
was not called for any open DB_ENV handle.  In addition, at least
one transaction checkpoint must be performed after all existing
transactions have been committed or aborted.
<p><li>Recovery must be single-threaded, that is, one thread of control or
process must perform recovery before any other thread of control or
processes attempt to create or join the Berkeley DB environment.
</ol>
<p>It simplifies matters that recovery may be performed regardless of whether
recovery strictly needs to be performed, that is, it is not an error to
run recovery on a database where no recovery is necessary.
<p>There are two common ways to build transactionally protected Berkeley DB
applications.
<p>The most common way to build Berkeley DB applications is as a single, usually
multi-threaded, process.  This architecture is simplest because it
requires no monitoring of other threads of control.  When the application
starts, it opens and potentially creates the environment, runs recovery,
and then opens its databases.  From then on, the application can create
new threads of control as it chooses.  All threads of control share the
open Berkeley DB DB_ENV and DB handles.  In this model, databases
are rarely opened or closed when more than a single thread of control is
running, that is, they are opened when only a single thread is running,
and closed after all threads but one have exited.  The last thread of
control to exit closes the databases and the environment.
<p>A less common way to build Berkeley DB applications is as a set of cooperating
processes, which may or may not be multi-threaded.  This architecture is
more complicated.
<p>First, this architecture requires that the order in which processes are
created and subsequently access the Berkeley DB environment be controlled,
because recovery must be single-threaded.  The first process to access
the environment must run recovery, and no other process should attempt to
access the environment until recovery is complete.  (This ordering
requirement does not apply to environment creation without recovery. If
multiple processes attempt to create a Berkeley DB environment, only one will
perform the creation and the others will join an existing environment.)
<p>Second, this architecture requires that processes be monitored.  If any
process which acquires Berkeley DB resources exits, without first cleanly
discarding those resources, recovery is usually necessary.  Before running
recovery, all processes using the Berkeley DB environment must relinquish all
of their Berkeley DB resources (it does not matter if they do so gracefully or
because they are forced to exit).  Then recovery can be run and the
processes continued or re-started.
<p>The safest way to structure groups of cooperating processes is to first
create a single process that opens the Berkeley DB environment and runs
recovery, and which then creates processes that will actually perform
work.  The initial process is given no further responsibilities other than
to monitor the processes it has created, to ensure that no process
unexpectedly exits holding Berkeley DB resources.  If one does, it then forces
all of the processes that are using the Berkeley DB environment to exit, runs
recovery, and restarts the working processes.
<p>If it is not practical to have a single parent for the processes sharing
a Berkeley DB environment, each process sharing the environment should log their
connection to and exit from the environment in some fashion that permits
a monitoring process to detect if a thread of control may have potentially
acquired Berkeley DB resources and never released them.
<p>Obviously, it is important that the monitoring process in either case be
as simple and well-tested as possible as there is no recourse should it
fail.
