<h1 align=center>Logically renumbering records</h1>
<p>Records stored in the Queue and Recno access methods are accessed by
logical record number.  Invariably in Queue databases, and by default in
Recno databases, these record numbers are not mutable.  That is to say,
if you delete record number 5, record number 6 is not automatically
renumbered to be record number 5 and 7 renumbered to be record number 6
and so on.  For this same reason, new records cannot be inserted between
already-existing records.
<p>Record numbers in Btree databases are always mutable, and as records are
deleted or inserted, the logical record number for other records in the
database can change.
<p>In Recno databases, it is possible to make the logical record numbers
mutable by calling the <a href="../../api_c/db_set_flags.html">DB-&gt;set_flags</a> function with the <a href="../../api_c/db_set_flags.html#DB_RENUMBER">DB_RENUMBER</a>
flag.  This means that the record numbers may change as records
are added to and deleted from the database.
When record numbers are mutable, cursors behave quite a bit differently
than usual.
<p>For example, the deletion of record number 4 causes records numbered 5
and greater to be renumbered downward by 1.  If a cursor is positioned at
a record less than 4 before the deletion, it will be unchanged.  If a
cursor is positioned at a record greater than 4 before the deletion, it
will be shifted downward 1 logical record number, continuing to reference
the same record as it did before.
<p>If a cursor was positioned at record 4 when it was deleted, one of
two things happens: if there were records greater than 4 when the
delete happened, the cursor will suddenly reference what was
previously record 5 and is now record number 4.  If there were no
records greater than 4 when the delete happened, the cursor will
suddenly reference record 3, that is, the largest record in the
database that exists.  When a delete removes the single remaining
record from a database, any open cursors will reference an invalid
record number, and operations relative to the current cursor
position, e.g., <a href="../../api_c/dbc_put.html">DBcursor-&gt;c_put</a> with the <a href="../../api_c/dbc_put.html#DB_BEFORE">DB_BEFORE</a> flag,
will fail.
<p>Similarly, if a created record is not at the end of the database, all
records following the new record will be automatically renumbered upward
by 1. For example, the creation of a new record numbered 8 causes records
numbered 8 and greater to be renumbered upward by 1. If a cursor was
positioned to record number 8 or greater before the insertion, it will be
shifted upward 1 logical record, continuing to reference the same record
as it did before.
<p>For these reasons, concurrent access to a Recno database with the
<a href="../../api_c/db_set_flags.html#DB_RENUMBER">DB_RENUMBER</a> flag specified is rarely useful (because threads of
control may renumber records being accessed by other threads of control),
although it is supported.
<p>In the case of Queue and Recno databases where record numbers are not
mutable, any attempt to retrieve deleted records will result in a special
error return, <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_KEYEMPTY">DB_KEYEMPTY</a>.
<p>When using both mutable and immutable record numbers, creating new records
will cause the creation of multiple records if the record number is more
than one greater than the largest record currently in the database. For
example, creating record number 28, when record 25 was previously the
last record in the database, will implicitly create records 26 and 27 as
well as 28.
<p>First, last, next and previous cursor operations will automatically skip
over implicitly created records.  For example, if record number 5 is the
only record the application has created, implicitly creating records 1
through 4, the <a href="../../api_c/dbc_get.html">DBcursor-&gt;c_get</a> interface with the <a href="../../api_c/dbc_get.html#DB_FIRST">DB_FIRST</a> flag
will return record number 5, not record number 1.  Attempts to explicitly
retrieve records that were created in this manner will result in a special
error return, <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_KEYEMPTY">DB_KEYEMPTY</a>.
