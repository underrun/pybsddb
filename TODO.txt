* 20080327: Add a parameter to DBEnv.log_flush().

* 20080402: If a prepared/recovered transaction is garbaged collected,
  we leak transactions. Can we call "discard" in a safe way?.

* 20080403: If an exception is raised in a thread in the TestSuite, we
  pass the test. Bad!.

* 20080403: Write a test for MVCC.

* 20080403: We should recreate the test data directory in every
  execution, and delete it when finished.

* 20080403: "txn_stat" provides a list of active transactions. Export it
  to Python.

* 20080426: Verify that "DB_ENV->set_event_notify" follows the API.

* 20080521: Write a test for "DB_ENV->set_rpc_server". This test would be
  called if there is a concrete environment variable defined, for example.

* 20080522: Think about changing the library name to "berkeleydb". See
  http://mailman.argo.es/pipermail/pybsddb/2008-March/000019.html

* 20080522: Update the "README.txt" document.

* 20080531: "DB_ENV->rep_set_limit" and "DB_ENV->rep_get_limit", support
  for long values.

* 20080629: The testsuite implements a "test_support" module, used when
  the underlying python version doesn't have it. Because a bug in the
  test code, this version is used always, even if this python version
  has "test_support". This is actually useful, because current test
  code uses features in "test_support" that are not available in
  previous python versions.

* 20080720: The test for crash documented in http://bugs.python.org/issue3307
  is disabled because it prints a error message to screen. Solve this and
  reenable the test. This would require "set_errfile" implementation.

* 20080721: When we drop Python 2.3 support, we should use "PyTuple_Pack".

* 20080807: The EGG for 4.7.2 was installed as a directory, not a
  ZIP file. Why?.

* 20080811: "DB.has_key()" must be retained in python3.0, since it allows
  a transaction parameter.

* 20080812: "DBEnv.db_home", under python3.0, is automatically converted
  to bytes. What charset is used?.

* 20080812: Since Python 3.0 dropped the "cmp" function in "sort()"
  methods, we need to handcode some "Insertion sort" functions, in
  the testsuite and in the production code. This is ugly and slow.

* 20080812: "test_all.do_proxy_db_py3k()" is a very ugly hack. For
  example, if a test fails, it can leave the testsuite in an
  inconsistent state, causing spurious failures.

* 20080812: We use "getattr()" to avoid "obj.next()" automatic
  conversion via "2to3" tool. Improve this.

* 20080812: Python 3.0 idioms available in 2.6 and up should be
  used also in this versions.

* 20080813: Create a "__contains__" routine in DB, etc, to use
  when 2to3 tools translate "has_key" to "in".

* 20080813: We use "getattr()" to avoid "obj.has_key()" automatic
  conversion via "2to3" tool. Improve this, specially in
  "dbtables.py".

* 20080813: We can store "None" values in a database. How can we
  differenciate between stored "None" and NotFound?. We can
  use exceptions or the "default" parameter, but... this is ugly.

* 20080813: TO INVESTIGATE (posible bug in Berkeley DB): if you
  duplicate a duplicated cursor, crash.

* 20080813: The put_bytes/get_bytes technique in "dbtables" is
  nice, but the "getattr" method is not. The problem is that
  DB objects can't grow new attributes. Solve this.

* 20080814: If pybsddb classes would be subclassed, we could
  implement conversion methods for keys and values in
  a very elegant way. This is specially relevant in Python 3.0.

  When done, delete "StringValues" and "StringKeys" in
  Python native "test_bsddb.py".

* 20080814: If we could subclass the bsddb objects, we could
  drop "dbobj.py" (a bit outdated by now).

* 20080918: If "DB_close_internal()" fails in DB_verify, we
  should close the DB handle.
