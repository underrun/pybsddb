* 20080327: Add a parameter to DBEnv.log_flush().

* 20080402: If a prepared/recovered transaction is garbaged collected,
  we leak transactions. Can we call "discard" in a safe way?.

* 20080403: If an exception is raised in a thread in the TestSuite, we
  pass the test. Bad!.

* 20080403: Write a test for MVCC.

* 20080403: We should recreate the test data directory in every
  execution, and delete it when finished.

* 20080403: "txn_stat" provides a list of active transactions. Export it
  to Python.

* 20080426: Verify that "DB_ENV->set_event_notify" follows the API.

* 20080521: Write a test for "DB_ENV->set_rpc_server". This test would be
  called if there is a concrete environment variable defined, for example.

* 20080522: Think about changing the library name to "berkeleydb". See
  http://mailman.argo.es/pipermail/pybsddb/2008-March/000019.html

* 20080522: Update the "README.txt" document.

* 20080531: "DB_ENV->rep_set_limit" and "DB_ENV->rep_get_limit", support
  for long values.

* 20080531: "DB_ENV->rep_elect" only works in BDB 4.7, with current code.

* 20080629: Timeout value in the test_replication code is a workaround.
  The right thing to do would be tweak the different replication timeout
  values to avoid the race condition.

* 20080629: The testsuite implements a "test_support" module, used when
  the underlying python version doesn't have it. Because a bug in the
  test code, this version is used always, even if this python version
  has "test_support". This is actually useful, because current test
  code uses features of "test_support" that are not available in
  previous python versions.
