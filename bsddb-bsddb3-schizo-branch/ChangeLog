4.1.2 - 2003-01-17:

 * Shared all .py and .c source with the Python project.
 * Fixed DBTxn objects to raise an exception if they are used after
   the underlying DB_TXN handle becomes invalid. (rather than
   potentially causing a segfault)
 * Fixed module to work when compiled against a python without thread
   support.
 * Do not attempt to double-close DB cursor's whos underlying DB
   has already been closed (fixes a segfault).
 * Close DB objects when DB.open fails to prevent an exception about
   databases still being open when calling DBEnv.close.
	
4.1.1 - 2002-12-20:

 * Fixed a memory leak when raising exceptions from the database
   library.  Debugged and fixed by Josh Hoyt <josh@janrain.com>.  Thanks!
   (sourceforge patch 656517)

4.1.0 - 2002-12-13:

 * Updated our version number to track the latest BerkeleyDB interface
   version that we support.
 * Simplified the build and test process.  Now you should just be able
   to say "python setup.py build" and "python setup.py install".  Also
   added a nice test.py harness.  Do "python test.py -h" for details.
 * The windows binary is build against BerkeleyDB 4.1.24 with current
   eight patches issued by Sleepycat applied.
 * REMINDER: BerkeleyDB 4.1 requires code changes if you use database
   transactions.  See the upgrade docs on http://www.sleepycat.com/.

3.4.3 - 2002-10-18:

 * added support for BerkeleyDB 4.1:  DB.open and DB.associate
   will now accept a txn keyword argument when using BerkeleyDB 4.1.
   DBEnv.dbremove, DBEnv.dbrename, DBEnv.set_encrypt and DB.set_encrypt
   methods have been exposed for 4.1.

3.4.2 - 2002-08-14:

 * dbtables.py: serious bug fix.  The Select, Modify and Delete methods could
   all act upon rows that did not match all of the conditions.  (bug # 590449)
   A test case was added.
 * dbutils.py: updated DeadlockWrap
 * test_threads.py: fixed to use dbutils.DeadlockWrap to catch and avoid
   DBLockDeadlockError exceptions during simple threading tests.

3.4.1:

 * fixed typo cut and paste bugs in test_dbsimple.py and test_threads.py
 * fixed bug with cursors where calling DBCursor.close() would cause
   the object's destructor __del__() method to raise an exception when
   it was called by the gc.
 * fixed a bug in associated callbacks that could cause a null pointer
   dereference when python threading had not yet been initialized.

3.4.0:
 
 * many bugfixes, its been a long while since a new package was created.
 * ChangeLog started.
